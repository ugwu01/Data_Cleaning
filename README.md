# Data_Cleaning
Hi, my name is Stephen. I'm a Data Analyst and Python Programmer. 
I’m interested in Data, people and Business Analytics.
I currently use Python to complement SQL and Power BI in data querrying, manipulation and visualization. 
I did an indebt data cleaning exercise on this project. The project aims to text how well i can clean and preprocess messy data for further analysis by a data scientist.
